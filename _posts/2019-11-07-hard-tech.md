When thinking about what I want to work on, I am most inspired by *deep tech/hard tech/high tech/whatever-you-call-it tech*. I love the ambition of it.  
 
I would be happy if more people and companies working on those inspiring challenges. And I want to help them. But how? How can we do that?

The advice from Paul Graham in [how to have startup ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) is to get to the edge of a technology (either as a user or creator) and build what is missing. Does this advice apply to hard problems or only product market fit type problems? 

[According to Jered Friedman](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/78) most of Y Combinator advice still applies to hard tech companies and [Sam Altman says the same](https://blog.ycombinator.com/hard-tech-startups/). (Sorry it’s always Y Combinator sources, but they have great resourses).

*They claim starting a hard tech company is easier than a "normal company" AND that most of the advice out there is still useful to you. Good news eh? [slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ap29s2gg5ia1f4b/Jared%20Friedman%20-%20Advice%20for%20hard-tech%20and%20biotech%20founders.pdf?dl=0)*

So there’s resources with blueprints for how we can get going. But still, don’t you need to be special to work on these types of problems? [ Like, really special ](http://www.sciradioactive.com/about-me). 

I can imagine that if I go home at Christmas and say that I’d like to develop a cheaper drilling method for geothermal energy wells, I would get some strange looks. If I said I’m aiming for wells that are kilometers deep I would feel that I am saying something ridiculous. Something impossible.

But there are examples of people that just started working on something huge without any extraordinary genius advantage. [John Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Crowley_(biotech_executive)) built a biotech company for his daughters. Blake Scholl (a software engineer) started a supersonic aeroplane company because he liked planes.

His company Boom isn't yet a home run winner, but that’s not the point. The point is that they are trying something extremely ambitious and that they aren’t aliens, just American. Snippets from [an interview](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/boom-wants-to-build-a-supersonic-jet-for-mainstream-passengers-heres-its-game-plan/) with Blake Scholl show it:

>TC: Blake, you [spent a handful of years with Amazon, working on mobile shopping, then Groupon acquired a mobile payment company you’d co-founded, Kima Labs, and you stayed on]. So you’re at Groupon. You don’t have an aerospace background. But you decide that you are the guy to start a supersonic jet company. How did that happen?
>
>BS: It goes back to the decision I made to sell [Kima Labs] . . . I thought, is it worth what I will go through personally for the product we’re building, or should I take the great offer and live to found another day? And so I took the offer, and in reflecting on that, what I realized is, like, all startups are hard. There’s no such thing as an easy startup… 
>
>My personal passion for a long time had been airplanes… And so I thought, I have to look at the supersonic thing that I’ve been sort of thinking about for a decade, and do some research, and probably get it out of my system.
>
>The first thing was to understand why it hadn’t been done already… 
>
>[So I went back to] first principles and [thought], the Concorde was created 50 years ago with slide rules and wind tunnels. And half a century later, [I wondered] why is that not working, and what would it take, and the answer was that the fuel economy was the problem. It was too expensive to operate, [so] none of the people could afford to fly on it. And you start to run the numbers and say, well — by the way, all this stuff you can do out of Wikipedia — what would you have to do to make this economically feasible? It turns out the answer is [to make the fuel efficiency] 30% [better] versus what was designed a long time ago. And you start to realize, that doesn’t sound impossible. [So] I went off and read some aerospace textbooks, and took a design class, and started to meet everybody I could find in the industry, and I told them to shoot holes in my idea. And eventually, people started saying, ‘No, this actually makes sense.’ And so we started the company.

When I talk to English friends about languages they often say things like “I wish I’d tried to learn when I was young, it would’ve been so easy… it’s too late now”. But that’s self-delusion. That’s putting work on a version of yourself that isn’t you.
 
It’s not too late. You didn’t have to start when you were six, you have to start now and keep trying and for 6 months you need to sound stupid when you talk.

I feel that same cop-out thinking when I'm considering hard technology problems. I’m not a genius. I didn’t build a bomb when I was 12. I was playing fifa at age 15, not hacking into government databases. I feel ridiculous at the thought of trying anything outlandish.

I hope that is wrong. If everything remarkable had to be done by a genius, surely we wouldn’t be as far as we are now? Surely the lucky ones of us who can just need to dare?

I think some advice I once got from someone who isn't in Y Combinator may be useful. During my masters I was studying gaussian processes on the train and understanding none of it, the guy opposite me got up to leave, and as he was going he said 

>“If it was easy, we’d all be doing it. Stick at it.” 

Stick at it.
