I complained [before](http://www.beeark.eu/sustainability/2020/02/16/lazy-green-investing/) that sustainable finance is too much hard work. I think Yale may be building [something that could fix it](https://openlab.yale.edu/open-solar). 

It's an Open Source platform that anyone could use to build a [decentralised community infrastructure or climate finance platform](https://docs.openx.solar/openx/intro) on top of. Hence the name [OpenX](https://github.com/YaleOpenLab/openx).

It seems similar to [Wunder Captial](https://www.wundercapital.com/) or [Sun Exchange](https://thesunexchange.com/about-us) (Blockchain based). But its Open Source! Anyone who dislikes the current solar financing platforms would have a way to compete fairly quickly. Or to take the X of OpenX seriously and try another market.

The repo is active and has been active for a long time. The code already appears quite far along. The [documentation](https://docs.openx.solar/openx/intro) is solid. The ambitions of the project look great, if this Open Source project was running and available a great sustainability platforms could exist more easily. You could argue that makes the business an uninteresting race to the bottom. But from the worlds point of view it seems a good race to run.

One confusion I have is their choice to build on the [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) blockchain. [They have a thorough analysis](https://gist.github.com/Varunram/b8c0da7b9d553fb0be233be1f99b0d29) of the pros and cons of many blockchains and have a [spreadsheet that seems to show Ethereum as the winner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6HwnCwCMZ1yMZqEkVnr2Pw777mmAwhBQHiX1vnC9VM/edit#gid=0) so perhaps they change technology soon. [I asked here](https://github.com/YaleOpenLab/opensolar/issues/150).

One very major problem is that the [Bus Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of the project looks like [it's 1](https://github.com/YaleOpenLab/opensolar/graphs/contributors). Maybe me? Maybe you? Should make that Bus Factor 2.
