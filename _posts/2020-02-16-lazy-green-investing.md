I'd like to invest some of my money into producing more green energy while also having the possibility of earning some interest for retired me.

I haven't yet looked into [sustainble financial instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/11/going-green-with-etfs.asp) and they may well be a good option, but this is more an observation about the smaller scale, green project, crowd-funding like platforms that exist.

The model they all follow is much like KickStarter. There is a list projects on their platforms with info on what the project is, how much energy it will produce/save, expected returns etc. What I find strange is that there are no invest and forget offers on their platforms. I can't evaluate the quality of a project based on 5 bullet points and even with a more thorough prospectus I'm limited in how well I can evaluate the probability of the projects hitting their targets. Especially as the platforms don't focus much on the returns of past projects but focus on selling new ones.

I would rather invest with a company who themselves are heavily invested in their own fund, let them choose the projects and provide me with a return (or a description of why the markets were impossible to navigate this year). I would be suprised if I was the only person who would pay for this so I wonder why no one is doing it? Of course there is a chance that people were and they all failed for reasons obvious to all the people choosing not to follow this model.
