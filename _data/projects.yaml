    The catheter moves through the aorta generating points in 3D space. 
    Thats the slowly growing red thing. 
    The algorithm to automatically perform the registration is a particle filter combined with registration. 
    The pink dots (the particles) show the starting points of the registration, at each step the best starting locations are kept with some randomness thrown in. 
    Overtime the particles converge to an optimum based on the registration error. 
    The idea is that this lets image registration occur in real time during a surgery and the particles would let the surgeon cycle through different possible registrations to choose the best one.

    A demo of the app I built to help me learn german. 
    I was using many different apps to practice so I just combined them all into one.
    I listen to podcasts/watch videos and read the transcript at the same time.
    When I don't know a word I can just tap it to see the oxford dictionary translation.
    I added an option to save translations or examples from the dictionary and these go straight to the built in flashcards along with the original sentence that I saw the word in. 
    Handy huh? :)
