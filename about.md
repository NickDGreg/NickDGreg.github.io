title: About

I'd love to see a world with vast supplies of clean energy and production; one where we can go on inventing, growing, and pushing and simultaneously not worry about damaging what allows us to exist. Just a little more harmony you know. I guess no one would disagree with that, right? But the details are complicated.

I wonder if there is something I'm suited to that could help make that happen. I wonder if more people doing random, creative, bold work would be a great thing irrespective of what they work on. What I write is loosely around those topics. 

I change my mind overtime, but I've decided to leave the old posts even once my thinking has moved on. So if you read something and think: "what a moron", maybe I agree with you.

A factual bio: I'm 25, from England, and living in Zurich. I work in software and machine learning.
