I'd love to see a world with vast supplies of clean energy and production; one where we can go on inventing, growing, and pushing and simultaneously not worry about damaging what allows us to exist. Just a little more harmony you know.

I'm currently trying to find out how I can spend my working hours to help make that happen and I'm writing what I find.

I am changing my mind as I learn more, but I've decided to leave the old posts even once my thinking has moved on. So if you read something and think what a moron, maybe I agree with you.

A factual bio: I'm 25, from England, and living in Zurich. I work in software and machine learning.
