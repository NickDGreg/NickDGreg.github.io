  Hey! I created this site because maths and machine learning can be a struggle. I share resources and explanations that have made it a little more intuitive for me.

## Website

This website was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The theme used is [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo). Many thanks to him for creating it and making it freely available!
