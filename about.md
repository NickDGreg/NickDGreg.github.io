Am I economically irrelevant? I believe so.

Two years ago I finished university; well developed into the typical ideological young person. Strong opinions about how the world should be better. How the problems, the real problems need to be worked on, not these frivolous BS activities that are so utterly pointless but mysteriously well rewarded. I began job searching.

There were some organisations that were obviously valuable, but me joining them - was that valuable? What’s one more Googler? 

Maybe startups have something to offer? But they didn’t look worthwhile to me. Another “AI” driven data analytics company helping You to Understand Your Customers, even if they claimed to be Building the World of Tomorrow… … Today, I was not inspired. 

I took a job where I thought I would learn the most. I tried not to stress about the output. 

Although I used the past tense, my only mellowing since then is understanding that people with completely different values would not view work the same way. So I no longer attack their personal choices, but I maintain that much of the work done on this planet is not useful or is even negative. I think Douglas Adams observed our origins from Golgafrinchin accurately. We are the B-Arkers. 

This is a hard feeling to take to work for two years. I want to see if what I value can stand up in the economy barrelling along around us.

I’ve wondered about a company where the language used is honest, simple, maybe even creative. Where ambitions are brave and untried, where employees create their own whorl in the economy, where they can even own that. Why is that not the way its done?

This site is a record of trying just that. Hopefully it can even contribute to making it real. Maybe even find people who can help. And in the worst case I end up with some shameless self-promotion material or an empty website with an overly passionate about page.
